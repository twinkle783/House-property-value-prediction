# House property value prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict
house property values, achieving 95% prediction
accuracy using GradientBoostingRegressor.
Conducted comprehensive exploratory data
analysis (EDA) on over 10000 housing records to
uncover key trends and insights.
Utilized Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy,
and Matplotlib for model development and data
visualization.
